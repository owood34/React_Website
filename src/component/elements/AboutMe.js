            Hello, I am Owen Wood. I am an aspiring web developer and software developer. 
            It all started back in the days developing Minecraft Mods and Plugins. 
            Even in the beginning I loved the problem solving and satisfaction of getting a 
            task done (After the headbanging of course). 
            Now, I am looking for new challenges that await me after college. 
            Graduating with a 3.71 with a Major in Computer Science and Minoring in both Mathematics and Art.
